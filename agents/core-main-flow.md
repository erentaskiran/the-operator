# Core Main Flow

Source file: `js/main.js`

## Responsibilities

- Bootstraps the game startup flow.
- Holds global game state and entity objects.
- Registers scenes (`menu`, `play`) and wires update/render integration.
- Performs asset preload, map loading, and animation setup.

## High-Level Flow

1. Get canvas/context and initialize input.
2. Create player/enemy/goal entities and global `state`.
3. Define helper functions (spawn/goal/enemy lane/animation/background, etc.).
4. Register `menu` and `play` scenes.
5. Pass main `update` and `render` callbacks into the game loop.
6. In `boot()`, preload assets, load map, and build animation sets.
7. Switch to `menu` scene and start the loop.
