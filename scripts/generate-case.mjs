OUTPUT RULES:

RULES:
- Realistic modern role (e.g. restaurant owner, contractor, CFO, landlord, doctor)
- The suspect must be morally ambiguous
- profile must include:
  - background
  - career
  - personality traits
  - one suspicious detail
  - one humanizing detail
- motive must connect to a potential lawsuit or wrongdoing
- secret must NOT be obvious but meaningful
- credibility must be 1-10 with subtle reasoning implied`;

OUTPUT RULES:

OUTPUT:

RULES:
- Must describe a legal dispute or lawsuit
- Clearly define:
  - who is accusing whom
  - what happened
  - why the suspect is under investigation
- Must include ambiguity (not clearly guilty or innocent)
- Should naturally connect to the suspect's motive and secret
- Keep context concise (4-6 sentences)`;

RULES:

NODE COUNT:
- 5 to 7 total nodes
- Must include:
  - node_01_intro (intro node)
  - 3-4 investigation nodes
  - exactly 1 success end node (id contains "success", e.g. node_success_*)
  - 1+ fail end nodes (id contains "fail", e.g. node_fail_*)

NODE FIELDS (ALL nodes, including end nodes):
- theme: short scene label, 2-5 words, Title Case or descriptive phrase
- description: one or two sentences setting the scene for the player (the operator)
- is_end_state: boolean

NON-END NODES:
- is_end_state: false
- at least 2 choices
- NO result_text

END NODES:
- is_end_state: true
- result_text: in-game payoff text shown to the player
- NO choices

CHOICE.type:
- Free-form UPPER_SNAKE_CASE descriptive label conveying the tactic
- Pick names that reflect the move: ANALYTICAL, EMPATHIC, FORENSIC_CALL_OUT,
  AGGRESSIVE, STRATEGIC, LEGAL_THREAT, MORAL_PRESSURE, NARROW_TARGET,
  SYSTEMIC_READ, GULLIBLE, TRAP, PRESSURE, EVIDENCE — or invent something
  equally specific to the scene
- Note: use EMPATHIC (not EMPATHETIC) to match existing data

MECHANICS (choose the value that fits the suspect's reaction):
- heart_rate: BASELINE | STABLE | RISE | INCREASE | SPIKE | MAX_SPIKE | DROP | ERRATIC
- breathing: BASELINE | CALM | DEEP | SHALLOW | HOLDING_BREATH | UNEVEN | HYPERVENTILATION | CRYING
- gsr: BASELINE | STABLE | INCREASE | SPIKE | SURGE | MAX | DECREASE
- eeg: BASELINE | FOCUSED | INCREASE | CHAOTIC | ERRATIC | DROP | FLATLINE
- cctv_visual: free-form UPPER_SNAKE_CASE descriptive micro-expression or body
  cue (LIP_PRESS, JAW_TIGHTEN, EYE_DART, TEAR_POOLING, STONE_FACE,
  BREAKDOWN, EMPTY_STARE, RELEASED_SHOULDERS, DEFENSIVE_CROSS_ARMS,
  RELIEVED_EXHALE, LOOK_DOWN, MICRO_TWITCH, FROZEN, AVOIDANCE, etc.)
- korku_bari_delta: integer, roughly -50 to +50
  - negative = wrong move, suspect regains control
  - positive = right move, cracks the facade
- gameplay_note: short analyst-facing note tagging the signal
  (e.g. "LIE SIGNAL: ...", "PARTIAL TRUTH: ...", "WRONG MOVE: ...",
  "PROGRESS: ...", "CORRECT MOVE: ...")

GAMEPLAY DESIGN:
- At least one contradiction-discovery path (forensic / evidence-based)
- At least one misleading path (looks right but triggers fail)
- Good reasoning -> success node
- Poor reasoning -> fail node
- Answers must feel realistic (defensive, evasive, pressured, technical)

VALIDATION:
- All next_node values must refer to an existing node id in "nodes"
- start_node must exist in "nodes"`;

RULES:
- Copy suspect.name, role, profile from input
- Use title and context from case input
- Use start_node and nodes from nodes input VERBATIM — do not reshape or drop
  fields. Preserve theme, description, is_end_state, choices, mechanics,
  next_node, result_text exactly as given.
- fear_bar_description should explain emotional/psychological pressure tracking
- Do not include extra fields
- Ensure valid JSON`;
